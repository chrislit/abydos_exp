"""call_and_write_log.py

This helper script takes one argument, a call to pylint, pycodestyle,
or flake8. It captures stdout and writes it to a log file.

The reason for this script to exist is as a workaround for tox
not supporting writing to files, even though I want it to do that
to maintain logs & create badges.
